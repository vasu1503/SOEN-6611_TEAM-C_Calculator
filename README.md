 # TEAM C

This program aims to quantitatively describe a collection of data in a simple implementation.
There is no designated domain for the tool - i.e no business logic. The building blocks provided here do not resort to external libraries or APIs to perform calculations. 


There are a total of two classes in the source code: Statistics.java and DescriptiveStasticalCalculator.java.
DescriptiveStasticalCalculator contains the main method and controller which handles user input and random data generation.
Statistics.java contains the core logic of the calculator and the algorithms behind the calculations performed. 

To run the program please either download all files under src/ or  git clone https://github.com/vasu1503/SOEN-6611_TEAM-C_Calculator.git
If using Eclipse as an IDE, simply run main (DescriptiveStasticalCalculator)
This source code is also accompanied with a simple test suite which does not resort to the random data generation feature and uses a fixed / predictable dataset for verification.
